Designing Delightful Experiences

A Practical Guide to User Experience Design
-------------------------------------------

**This is scratch content for my forthcoming book for Smashing Magazine. I’m sharing it with you to give you additional guidance for the IXD303 Designing User Experiences module. Please don’t share this content, it’s a work in progress and I’m sharing it with you in draft form.**

This content summarises some of what we’ve been covering in the first couple of weeks and provides additional thoughts and tools.

**\/\* Content within comments (\/\* … \*\/) are notes to myself. \*\/**

The tools will follow as I refine them, I’ll also add some examples, inspired by our ‘UX School’ project. I’ll be adding to this file over the next few days, so keep an eye on this repo.

Chapter 2: Establishing an Effective Strategy
---------------------------------------------

**\/\* This content still needs a bit of tidying, but it’s a useful start. At the moment I’m pulling together content across various locations: my folder, my slides, my notes in Bear and Simplenote, and my sketchbook. \*\/**

An effective strategy doesn’t appear out of nowhere, it comes from research, and your research needs to be undertaken in a considered and systematic manner. By embracing a systematic approach to your strategy research you can build it in as a core part of your UX process, saving time and money, and leading to better outcomes.

It’s important to involve the wider design team in the strategy phase of the process, because it provides an understanding of:

+ **Context:** The domain that you’re designing for;
+ **Established Patterns:** Existing approaches that competitors are using to design and deliver successful products; and
+ **User Goals:** The goals your users are trying to satisfy.

By developing an understanding of the lie of the land, you can ensure that what you’re building is guided by an informed opinion and, as a result, is fit for purpose.

Good research takes time, but it’s critical to ensure that you invest this time – **at the start of the process** – to ensure that the time you spend designing and building a product is time spent well. As Jaime Levy puts it in her excellent book [UX Strategy][JL]:

> Solid investigative market research is like peeling an onion. The more layers you peel, the more you reveal.

It’s easy to get carried away with your enthusiasm at the start of a project and rush headlong into building something, but **don’t bypass the competitor analysis phase**. Do so and you’ll end up with superficially styled outcomes that, whilst aesthetically pleasing, more often than not don’t meet the users’ or the business’s goals.

Defining a UX strategy will help inform and guide what you’re building and provide you with lessons about what works and, just as importantly, what doesn’t.

Designing and building digital products is time-intensive and expensive. You can reduce costly mistakes by drawing on a solid base of research. To help you build a solid research foundation, I’ve provided a number of tools in this chapter that you can use to undertake your own competitor research. As with the previous chapter, I’ll be using the X School example to provide an insight into the process.



### Designing Without Context

<!-- p6, Cooper -->

We’ve all doubtless experienced digital products that don’t perform as expected and which deliver less than delightful experiences. Sadly, this is often the result of an ill-considered design process that hasn’t been informed by research.

Before you embark upon designing and building a digital product, it’s critical to allow time and space to identify your users’ goals and explore the existing marketplace so that you can design products that meet your users’ expectations.

Designing without context can lead to:

+ Ignorance about users and what their core goals are.
+ An over-reliance on adding features, often at the expense of satisfying the user’s core goals.
+ Conflicts of interest, where politics between different stakeholders can derail the focus on users’ goals.

A better approach is to position your users front and centre in the process so that you design for their needs. For your design to be successful, it’s critical to make an effort to understand: Who? What? Where? When? and Why?

+ Who will use this product?
+ What do they hope to achieve?
+ Where might they use it?
+ When will they use it?
+ Why might they use it and, equally, why they might use one product over another?

These questions – the Five Ws – are critical to successful problem solving, and yet they’re often overlooked in the design process or aren’t given enough time.

**\/\* I could possibly include a Five Ws template here. \*\/**



### Desirability, Capability and Viability

<!-- p12, Cooper -->

An understanding of what users need is just one of three pillars we need to factor in to design a successful product. We also need to consider what we’re capable of building and what will sustain a business. At the intersection of these three pillars lies potential success.

**\/\* Unpack this a little more, with reference to Cooper (~p12). Also include a diagram. \*\/**



### Undertaking Competitor Research

Undertaking competitor research will provide you with an understanding of existing solutions to the problem you’re addressing and give you the raw material you need to address the problem effectively.

By systematically analysing competitors’ products you’ll develop:

+ an understanding of users’ goals, and the tasks and activities they use to achieve those goals.
+ an awareness of existing technical solutions to the problems you’re designing; and
+ an insight into existing business models within the market.

<!-- I’m building this list off the ‘Desirability, Capability and Viability’ list. -->

Undertaking systematic research provides you with the raw material to develop a systematic analysis. This will enable you to identify established patterns used in the context you’re designing for and pinpoint possible gaps in the market that you can exploit to differentiate your product.

Your goal at this stage of the process is to filter the research outcomes you discover into digestible and actionable insights that inform your strategy.
