X School · Initial Ideas
========================

**This is a case study for the book Designing Delightful Experiences: A Practical Guide to User Experience Design.**

Drawing upon my research, I’ve started to identify a list of possible elements that the X School learning platform might include.

This list – whilst not set in stone at this initial, competitor analysis phase – will provide some useful material to generate discussion with the different stakeholders. This will also allow us to consider how the project might be delivered from a **user-first** perspective.


### Comprehensive Digital Course

The backbone of the digital learning platform will be a comprehensive series of consistently branded digital materials. This might include:

+ Welcome Video
+ Eight Modules *
	+ 40+ Lessons *
+ Slidedeck PDFs
+ Transcripts
+ Worksheets

\* Further research and discussion with the stakeholders will inform the exact number of modules that will be offered. At this stage, I’m just trying to get a feel for the scope of the platform.


### Bonus Studio Materials

A nice to heave – that would help with the marketing of the platform – would be a series of bonus studio materials. These materials could be covered in the digital course – with example projects – then offered to learners to download as an added extra. This might include:

+ Templates
+ Sample Contracts
+ Swipe Files
+ Etc.


### Office Hours (Community)

After undertaking the competitor analysis, one thing that emerged was a need for learners to feel like they were part of a community. We might be building a digital learning platform, but that doesn’t mean we can’t consider ways to build community using digital tools.

Imagine access to weekly ‘office hours’ sessions for Q&A and support. This ensures learners feel supported as they undertake the course content. Additionally, mentoring support could be made available through the community focused on small learning groups.

Imagine inviting well-respected individuals from industry to contribute to regular topical discussions or AMAs (Ask Me Anythings). This would help with the marketing of the platform and strongly underline that the course content is taught from an industry relevant perspective.

Imagine being able to have AMAs on:

+ Design Systems with Alla Kholmatova or Brad Frost.
+ Pricing Your Work with Dan Mall or Mike Monteiro.
+ Icon Design with Jon Hicks or Vic Bell.

This – coupled with qualified mentors – would help underline the learning platform’s educationally sound learning focus.
