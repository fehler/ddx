X School · Competitor Analysis
==============================

**This is a case study for the book Designing Delightful Experiences: A Practical Guide to User Experience Design.**

After an initial scoping exercise, which included a wider range of digital learning platforms (including Udemy, Coursera and the Open University), I focused in on five competitors for analysis:

+ CareerFoundry
+ Butter Academy
+ SuperHi
+ Treehouse
+ FutureLearn

For each of these products, I’ve focused on:

+ Voice and Tone
+ Branding and Aesthetic
+ Course Content
+ Pricing
+ Marketing

It could be argued that marketing is beyond the scope of a typical project, but I think it’s important to consider as it provides a sense of how different competitors share their product stories.

I’ve gathered together my research below (and I’ll be adding to this with a visually-driven slidedeck shortly). This isn’t exhaustive research. If I were doing this for a client, I’d go into **much more depth**.

CareerFoundry
-------------

![CareerFoundry](screenshots/careerfoundry.png)

[https://careerfoundry.com](https://careerfoundry.com)

### Voice and Tone

CareerFoundry pitches itself as follows:

> Learn in-demand skills today and change your career.

The emphasis is very much on highlighting ‘in-demand’ skills and ‘changing your career’. This career-focused approach, coupled with the name, CareerFoundry, really underlines that the site’s target users have very clear goals in mind: Forging a new career.

The messaging is consistent throughout the site, with a strong emphasis on changing or enhancing your career, i.e. **studying with CareerFoundry is an investment**:

+ Courses to Change Your Career
+ Our Career Change Courses are designed as whole learning experiences to support your journey from the first exercise to a new career.
+ Online Mentored Courses With Job Guarantee


### Branding and Aesthetic

Overall, the branding and aesthetic is quite neutral (and a little on the serious side). The emphasis seems to be on **this is a site you can trust** and the site’s communicating **less fun-focused and more career-focused**.


### Course Content

Courses are broken down into two subsets: ‘Courses to Change Your Career’ and ‘Courses to Broaden Your Skill Set’. At a glance this suggests two different pricing tiers: changing career (£££); enhancing skills (£).

**Courses to Change Your Career**

+ UX Design
+ UI Design
+ Web Development

**Courses to Broaden Your Skill Set**

+ UX Fundamentals
+ Voice User Interface Design
+ UI for UX Designers
+ Frontend Development for Designers


### Pricing (UX Design)

+ One Off Payment: £4,749 Upfront (Save £250)
+ Monthly Payment Plan: £400 x 10 months + £999 Upfront


### Marketing

CareerFoundry prominently list ‘graduate destinations’, with a list of high profile companies graduates are now working for. **Our graduates now have tech jobs at companies all over the world:** Google, PayPal, Amazon, Facebook, Visa…

There’s a ‘Got questions?’ box in the footer with a prompt to ‘Ask Olivia’. There’s also a small call to action underneath this with a prompt to ‘Connect with a Career Advisor’ (this text is actually a link, although it doesn’t look like one).

Lastly, there’s an offer of a Free Webinar: “How to become a UX designer even if you don’t have previous tech or design skills.” There are also free email introductory courses, which presumably give a flavour of the teaching.

The overall messaging emphasises that almost anyone can take a course with CareerFoundry and change career.

Butter Academy
--------------

![Butter Academy](screenshots/butteracademy.png)

[http://butteracademy.com](http://butteracademy.com)

### Voice and Tone

Butter Academy pitches itself as, “A better way to learn UX Design.” As they put it:

> Want to become a UX Designer? Master the fundamentals with our online course and watch your career in UX take off.

The language used is somewhat informal, with an emphasis on what you’ll learn. Some of the language used is a little concerning, like: “Start now, finish whenever.” This suggests a lack of urgency over completing the course.

Whilst it’s understandable that this course might be pitched as something to undertake in your own time, this emphasis on ‘finish whenever’ undermines confidence in the outcome.

+ No fluff or BS. You’ll get the skills you need to excel in UX Design.
+ You’ll learn how to create user-friendly websites and apps from scratch and solve real world business problems with design solutions.
+ Polished Portfolio Work.


### Branding and Aesthetic

The branding and aesthetic is underpinned by a strong colour palette (yellow) that gives the brand a clear sense of visual cohesion.

The photography used leans a little too much towards stock photography and all looks a little off-the-shelf. The imagery doesn’t suggest real people, rather an idealised picture.

The typography’s a mix of a serif (Abril Fatface) and sans serif (Raleway) type. The typographic palette coupled with the strong colour palette gives the site a very contemporary and consistent feel.


### Course Content

Course content is delivered through a combination of video lessons (18) and practical assignments (6) resulting in a **polished portfolio of work** and a **certificate of completion**. The course is broken down as follows: 

+ Fundamentals of UX Design
+ User Research
+ Information Architecture
+ Wireframes and Prototypes
+ Usability Testing
+ Final Project


### Pricing

+ $195 (One Off Payment)


### Marketing

The site uses testimonials with what look like real photographs of real people. The testimonials are, however, a little on the short side. I think it would build believability to feature some more in-depth user recommendations.

There’s a list of brands on the home page (Virgin, BBVA, Nestlé…), but looking at the content these don’t appear to be graduate destinations, more the companies the course creator – Daniel Salgado – has worked for.

There’s a prominent ‘Get More Info’ call to action button that leads to a page with a simple form to submit your name and email address. Other than that, there appears to be very little other marketing.

SuperHi
-------

![SuperHi](screenshots/superhi.png)

[https://www.superhi.com](https://www.superhi.com)

### Voice and Tone

Although SuperHi is primarily focused on building websites, it also has a [UX course][SHUX]. The language used is focused on empowerment:

> Everything you need to create well-designed digital projects that you have full control over. No templates and no dull lessons.

There’s an emphasis on support, with: “Support that actually helps.” Support seems to be through a Slack community with a focus on, “learning to code together.” Support’s also provided by a worldwide team.

+ Support that actually helps.
+ Real-world projects you’ll want to create and remix.
+ Structured, and flexible.

There’s a strong emphasis on reaching goals quickly:

> Our course is practical, unlike other programs that take forever before you make your first real-world project.

From a voice and tone perspective, the focus is on the creative industries, stressing that the course isn’t a computer science lecture. This is echoed in the design, which is colourful and friendly.


### Branding and Aesthetic

The branding and aesthetic is built around a strong, bright colour palette with a bright blue accent colour. The look and feel – which is built around illustrations – is friendly and approachable.

Course outlines are provided via branded PDFs, which help to underpin the brand.


### Course Content

To get the full UX syllabus users need to sign up by leaving an email address. Leaving your email address immediately takes you to a PDF of the curriculum, there’s no need to open your email client.

This is beneficial for a couple of reasons:

1. SuperHi are able to gather emails for marketing; and
2. Potential users get to see the syllabus right away without an annoying trip to their email client.

The UX course is a, “go-at-your-own-pace short course,” with 8+ hours of content, so it’s quite focused. It’s built around ‘Lessons’ as opposed to ‘Modules’ and is broken down as follows:

+ Lesson 1: Introduction to UX
+ Lesson 2: Project: Marketplace All
+ Lesson 3: Research
+ Lesson 4: Analysis
+ Lesson 5: Wireframing (Mistakenly labelled ‘Lesson 4’.)
+ Lesson 6: Prototyping

The focus is on using Figma for prototyping, which is: free, cloud-based and available for macOS and Windows.


### Pricing (Intro to User Experience Design)

+ $149 (One Off Payment)


### Marketing

The site has a First Steps Guide, which offers “seven days of free coding wisdom”, delivered (via screencasts, presumably) by SuperHi’s founder Rik Lomas. The language used emphasises the number of past students:

> Did we mention tens of thousands of people have already read the guide and it’s totally free?

The reference to ‘thousands’ builds believability.

The site also uses Intercom to allow potential users to get in touch with the team, encouraging users to leave contact details.

Treehouse
---------

![Treehouse](screenshots/treehouse.png)

[https://teamtreehouse.com](https://teamtreehouse.com)

### Voice and Tone

The emphasis is very much on career change, with the strapline as follows:

> Learn to code, gain a new skill, get a new job.

Data is used upfront to build believability in the brand:

+ 300+ Courses
+ 278 Workshops
+ 23 Topics
+ 50k+ Current students

This gives the impression of an all you can eat buffet that might be overwhelming for potential users. (The Techdegrees (see below) provide a little more of a structured curriculum.)

There’s a very prominent focus on Treehouse Partnerships with Google, IBM, Amazon and Microsoft featured. (Presumably these are content partnerships?)

On the UX course, the language used is aspirational:

+ …start a new career as a UX Designer, who typically earns a starting salary of $75K a year.


### Branding and Aesthetic

The branding is built around a suite of colours (presumably colour-coding by content type?) and a friendly, rounded typeface (Gotham Rounded).

The site features a mix of illustrations and photographs (which look like photographs of real users). There’s an animated illustrated video on the home page, which gives a flavour of the course content and the different types of content available.


### Course Content

Treehouse offers ‘Techdegrees’. The use of language like ‘degrees’ (even though this degree doesn’t appear to be affiliated with a university) helps to build a sense that this is a worthwhile ‘qualification’ which has value.

> The Treehouse Techdegree is a structured, online learning program that will prepare you for a career in the tech industry.

I focused on the User Experience (UX) Techdegree. There’s no URL for this, the details appear in an overlay, I think a URL – that you could bookmark and share – would be better. Content is structured around ‘Units’ as opposed to ‘Lessons’ or ‘Modules’.

Unit 1: Critique a T-shirt Website
Unit 2: Complete a Wireframe
Unit 3: Pet Adoption Signup Form
Init 4: Prototyping a Weather App

At the bottom of this list, there’s a ‘learn more’ link that takes you to a URL:

	https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/ux-design

It would be easier for users if there was a link directly to this URL, bypassing the modal overlay.

This page is very comprehensive, with testimonials, a breakdown of information and a list of 15 Teachers and Guest Teachers. Confusingly the price for this Techdegree isn’t the $25 / Month listed on the home page, but $199 / Month.


### Pricing

This was a little confusing, the home page lists $25 / Month, but the UX Techdegree seems to be $199 / Month. I think this could be expressed a little more clearly. I couldn’t find a pricing page, something like that might be useful to provide an overview of prices.

User Experience (UX) Techdegree

+ $199 / Month


### Marketing

Treehouse offers a Free Trial, thereafter it’s $25 / Month. To ‘claim’ your free trial you need to leave your first name, last name, email address and a password, so you’re presumably setting up an account in the process. This helps onboard potential users and might lead to subscribers.

The site has a blog, which covers a wide range of subjects, so content marketing is a considered part of the marketing mix.

Treehouse offers an affiliate programme that is designed to drive subscribers.

There’s a modal popup that appears after a set period of time designed to drive free trials. The language used is, again, very focused on the career possibilities that Treehouse might lead to:

> With average starting salaries ranging from $40-75K a year, working in software development isn’t a job — it’s a career.

FutureLearn
-----------

![FutureLearn](screenshots/futurelearn.png)

[https://www.futurelearn.com](https://www.futurelearn.com)

### Voice and Tone

Futurelearn pitches itself as follows:

> Learn new skills, pursue your interests, advance your career.


### Branding and Aesthetic

The branding is clean and consistent with a very strong colour palette (pink) that’s used throughout the site. The iconography is very good, as is the typography, which is clean and consistent.

Look at the design patterns that are used, with different ‘modular blocks’ that are repeated:

+ Feature Courses
+ Smaller Menus of Courses


### Course Content

Look at the way course content is surfaced:

+ Popular Course
+ Important Topic

Although the content is considerable users are **eased in to it** with featured courses, with an accompanying ‘View all course categories’ link.
